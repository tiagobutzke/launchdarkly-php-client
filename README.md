Brief description
---
The [VOLO](https://www.volo.de) gets ported to [FoodPanda’s API](https://api-st.foodpanda.in/doc/v4/) (using which we can build the complete shop like if we would use the calls to the shop's core).

The VOLO will be based on the new version of food-panda shop (that uses symfony2 php-framework).
